# Ascent: AI-Powered Career Development Platform  
**TechFest 2026 Project**

Ascent is an AI-powered career development platform built for **TechFest 2026**, designed to help students and early-career professionals understand their job readiness, identify skill gaps, and receive structured, actionable guidance for career progression.

The platform differentiates itself through a **multi-agent large language model (LLM) architecture**, where multiple specialised AI agents analyse, critique, and refine career recommendations before producing a final outcome. This approach reduces bias, avoids overly generic advice, and delivers more balanced and realistic guidance.

[Insert 3-minute TechFest 2026 introduction video link here]

This video covers:
- Problem motivation and objectives
- System architecture and AI workflow
- Key features and user experience
- Design decisions and differentiators

*ps, currently the video has no voice over as we were too tired to record it during our hackathon. we will find time to record and reupload again in the near future.

## Problem Statement

Design a unified platform or application that helps fresh graduates transform fragmented career information into personalized, actionable roadmaps for employment.

---

## Key Features

### Multi-Agent Career Reasoning
- Resume text is extracted using OCR
- A primary LLM agent compares the resume against a target job role to identify skill gaps
- Identified gaps are matched against embedded SkillsFuture course data
- A secondary LLM agent critiques and challenges the initial recommendations
- Final outputs are refined through agent consensus

This design ensures recommendations are not produced by a single, unverified AI opinion.

---

### Personalized Career Roadmap
The platform generates a structured roadmap containing:
- Job match quality assessment
- Identified strengths and existing competencies
- Missing or underdeveloped skills
- Clear next steps for progression
- Relevant SkillsFuture courses mapped to each gap

---

### Industry-Specific Resume Optimization
Ascent provides access to **23 specialised AI agents**, each trained to evaluate resumes from a specific industry perspective.

Each agent:
- Reviews resumes using industry-relevant expectations
- Suggests targeted content improvements
- Displays original versus improved resume segments
- Provides concrete, actionable feedback

---

### User-Focused Interface Design
- Minimalist and distraction-free layouts
- Floating bottom navigation for consistent access
- Designed for students with varying levels of career readiness
